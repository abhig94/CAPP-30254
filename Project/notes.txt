Econmuckers:

1) Check where our data has been used? Is it reliable data that other people
have actually used or are we mucking around with a useless dataset?

2) How do we clean the data? Collapse columns? Split the data set certain ways?
Let a certain ML classifier handle the data?

3) We are predicting access to emergency funds. Are we also doing something with
financial inclusion?
